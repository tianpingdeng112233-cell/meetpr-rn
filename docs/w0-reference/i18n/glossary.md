# MeetPR i18n glossary

This glossary is the translation source of truth for the iOS app. Prefer the terms below over
literal translations so StudentKit, CoachKit, and the shared modules use the same training
language.

## Exercise names

- Display the current exercise catalog's `nameEn` verbatim in English. Do not translate an
  exercise name from its Chinese `name` at the call site.
- The bundled catalog currently contains 1,219 entries; the preview repository adds four
  synthetic competition lifts. Counts may change, but `nameEn` remains canonical for every
  catalog-backed exercise.
- Synthetic competition lifts use the live catalog `name_en` values verbatim: `Competition
  Squat`, `Competition Bench Press`, `Competition Deadlift` (conventional; the catalog omits
  "Conventional" — a known asymmetry with `Competition Sumo Deadlift`, renaming is a pending
  data-migration decision, do not "fix" it client-side).
- Examples from the catalog: `暂停深蹲` → `Pause Squat`; `节奏卧推` → `Tempo Bench`.

## Style

- Use sentence case for English labels and messages.
- Keep `kg`, `RPE`, `RIR`, `AMRAP`, `1RM`, `e1RM`, `PR`, and `SBD` unchanged.
- Use an en dash for ranges in prose where practical, and retain multiplication signs in compact
  prescriptions such as `100 kg × 5`.
- Preserve punctuation and wording in every `zh-Hans` value exactly as the pre-localization Swift
  literal. Localization must not rewrite Chinese copy.
